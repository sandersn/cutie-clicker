  Congrats! You found Cutie Clicker's menu!
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutie Clicker is unfinished. Changes will likely happen, and your data will probably be lost at least once.
  <br>
  <br>
  You'll notice that I'm leaving a lot of notes here and there in English. Eventually, I want Cutie Clicker to have minimal English, and instead have everything explained via pictures and stuff! That way, anyone can at least guess how stuff works, right?

      It looks like you're playing on http!

    If you decide to add Cutie Clicker to your phone's home screen, please make sure you're adding <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">https://cc.aideen.pw/</a> for (slightly) faster loading times.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wannya switch to https, feel free to <a href="https://cc.aideen.pw/">navigate there and update your bookmarks</a>. Note that in most cases, your game data won't carry over, which is why you don't get redirected automatically. If you want auto-redirection, just <a href="$misc">delete your http game data</a>, and you'll get redirected automatically! It's a safety measure I put in to make sure you don't just randomly lose your game unless you delete it yourself.
