Um. I'm a kittehgirl and I have no idea how this legal stuff works.

So I'm just gunnya say that this is all covered by "default
copyright," and you're allowed to share Cutie Clicker with your
friends and stuff, but only do so with the sole intention of playing
it as it is intended to be played for now. Please don't do anything
else without checking with me to see if it's okay first!
